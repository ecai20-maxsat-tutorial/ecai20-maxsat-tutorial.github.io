<p>
<i>Significant recent algorithmic and other methodological advances are establishing
maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) as a practical Boolean optimization paradigm applicable for solving
hard optimization problems arising from a wide range of AI and industrial domains.
This tutorial offers an accessible introduction and details on the current state of the art in MaxSAT solving
and its applications.</i>
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Many important AI problems involve an optimization component. Maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) is an optimization
version of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) that can be applied to a variety of  computationally hard optimization problems that arise in AI.
Constituting a declarative approach to optimization, modern state-of-the-art  MaxSAT solvers allow for
efficiently tackling NP-hard optimization problems arising from different applications
via simple propositional encodings.
<!-- for your application by using a MaxSAT solver.  -->                                                                                                                          
This can be much less time-consuming than building a customized algorithmic solution specific to a particular optimization problem.
Indeed, a well-engineered, generic MaxSAT solver can often be more efficient than a custom solution. Furthermore,
MaxSAT offers an alternative to the more classical declarative optimization paradigm of integer programming (IP), especially in the many AI applications where
the underlying problems are naturally represented with logical constraints.
</p>

<p>
Recent algorithmic and engineering advances are establishing  MaxSAT as a substantial approach
to efficiently solving NP-hard optimization problems arising from various AI and industrial applications, spanning
a wide range of major areas in AI, including machine learning, probabilistic graphical models, knowledge representation and reasoning,
verification and testing, automated planning and reasoning, etc.
A key aim of the tutorial is to make MaxSAT technology more understandable and accessible to researchers and practitioners working
in different areas of AI. 
<!--
Indeed, MaxSAT can be in many cases a viable alternative to both designing
specialized algorithmic solutions as well as to more classically considered declarative approaches
to solving hard optimization problems, in particular mixed-integer linear programming.
-->
In addition, the tutorial is expected to provide a more in-depth understanding of MaxSAT to both early-career and senior researchers
working on related constraint programming and declarative problem solving paradigms.
</p>

<h2>Focus of the Tutorial</h2>

<p>In this tutorial, we will introduce MaxSAT, give an overview of the different techniques that have been developed for solving MaxSAT,
focusing on recent advances and covering both complete and incomplete MaxSAT solving, and explain via case studies how MaxSAT has been used to 
solve problems from different areas of AI. We will also outline major current research directions in MaxSAT.
After this tutorial, you should be better equipped to assess whether or not MaxSAT would be useful in your work and better able to use modern MaxSAT solvers in your work. 
<!-- The tutorial assumes no background knowledge beyond what a new graduate student in computer science would possess.-->
</p>

<p>
The tutorial is targeted towards both researchers working on related areas in automated reasoning, knowledge representation, and optimization, as well as more generally 
towards a wide range of the ECAI audience who could benefit from obtaining further knowledge of
recent progress and state-of-the-art in MaxSAT solving and in applying MaxSAT to solve hard optimization problems arising from various AI and industrial problem domains.
The tutorial assumes no background knowledge beyond what a new graduate student in computer science would possess.
